## GUVNA GOVERNOR LAYER (Control System)

**Act 5 orchestrates Acts 1-4:**
- **Act 1:** Triangle (safety gate)
- **Act 2:** DDD/Hostess (disclosure level)
- **Act 3:** Kitchen/Core (interpretation passes)
- **Act 4:** RILIE (conversation response)
- **Act 5:** Guvna (final authority)

**Guvna Domains (Meta-Control):**
35 domains for governance, mood, tone, self-awareness, baseline lookup, domain lenses, wit detection, language modes

## SYNTHESIS: THE UNIFIED MAP

**678 Total Domains** → All demiglace to **bool/curve gates**

**Universal Pattern:** Every domain reduces to:
1. **Boolean gate:** decision point (TRUE/FALSE, trigger/hold)
2. **Curve:** parametric gradient (0-1, spectrum, continuous adjustment)

**Boole Substrate:** Single logical layer unifies all scales
- Quantum ↔ Classical ↔ Cosmic
- Molecules ↔ Cells ↔ Organisms ↔ Ecosystems
- Individual ↔ Collective ↔ Civilization
- Neural ↔ Linguistic ↔ Cultural

**Catch 44 Core:** 5 functions visible everywhere
1. **Track #0:** Mahveens (claim = deed, integrity)
2. **Track #2a:** Understanding (quality/quantity, density)
3. **Track #5:** WE > I (collective > individual)
4. **Track #23:** MOO (interruption, circuit break, awareness/momentum)
5. **Track #67:** EMERGENCE (complexity from simplicity)

## READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

**RILIE Brain:** 678 domains + Guvna control = operational

**Download This File:** Complete domain index for integration into guvna.py, RILIE response engine, and library access.

**Next Step:** Hook library_index.py to wire all 678 domains into domain lenses, SOi track mapping, and RILIE's core interpretation engine.
