# Act 5 â€“ The Governor

# Orchestrates Acts 1â€“4 by delegating to the RILIE class (Act 4 â€“ The Restaurant),
# which already wires through:
#   - Triangle (Act 1 â€“ safety / nonsense gate)
#   - DDD / Hostess (Act 2 â€“ disclosure level)
#   - Kitchen / Core (Act 3 â€“ interpretation passes)

# The Governor adds:
#   - Final authority on what gets served
#   - Optional web lookup (Brave/Google) as a KISS pre-pass
#   - Tone signaling via a single governing emoji per response
#   - Comparison between web baseline and RILIE's own compression
#   - CATCH44 DNA ethical guardrails
#   - Self-awareness fast path (_is_about_me)
#   - Wit detection + wilden_swift tone modulation
#   - Language mode detection (literal/figurative/metaphor/simile/poetry)
#   - Social status tracking (user always above self)
#   - Library index for domain engine access
